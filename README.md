Interactive UI: User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.

Machine Learning Models: Uses models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or BERT-based classifiers for text classification.

Text Processing: Includes text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization (e.g., TF-IDF or embeddings).

Real-time Prediction: Classifies user-input news headlines or articles and provides prediction confidence.

Explainability: Optionally highlights key words or phrases influencing the prediction.
